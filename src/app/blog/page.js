      <p class="mb-4">The pour-over is more than just a brewing method; it's a ritual. It gives you complete control over the extraction process, resulting in a clean, nuanced cup of coffee that highlights the unique flavors of the bean. Hereâ€™s how to master it.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-amber-900">What You'll Need:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-amber-800">
        <li>Quality coffee beans (freshly roasted, of course!)</li>
        <li>A gooseneck kettle for precise pouring</li>
        <li>A pour-over dripper (like a V60 or Kalita Wave)</li>
        <li>High-quality paper filters</li>
        <li>A digital scale and timer</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-3 text-amber-900">The Process:</h3>
      <p>The key is precision and patience. Start by rinsing your filter to remove any paper taste. Measure your beans and water carefully (a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio is a great starting point). Control your pour in slow, concentric circles, allowing the coffee to "bloom" first. The entire process should take about 3-4 minutes. The result is a cup that is truly worth the effort. Happy brewing!</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Our Morning Rise Blend isn't just a product; it's a relationship. It began with a trip to the Sidamo region of Ethiopia, a place renowned for its incredible coffee heritage. There, we met a cooperative of farmers dedicated to sustainable, organic practices passed down through generations.</p>
      <p>We work with them directly, ensuring they receive fair prices that empower their communities. The beans are hand-picked at peak ripeness, meticulously washed, and then sun-dried on raised beds. This careful process preserves the delicate floral and citrus notes that make this blend so special. When you drink our Morning Rise Blend, you're not just tasting coffee; you're tasting a story of community, dedication, and a shared love for an exceptional cup.</p>
